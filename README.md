In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## `Approaches Taken`

1. Component-Based Architecture:

   - **Reason**: React promotes a component-based architecture, which allows for reusable, maintainable, and testable code. This approach helps in organizing the project into smaller, manageable pieces.
   - **Approach**: I created reusable components like Navbar, Sidebar, Login, and User, which can be independently developed and tested.

2. **TypeScript for Strong Typing**:

   - **Reason**: TypeScript adds static type checking to JavaScript, which helps catch errors early during development, improves code readability, and makes the codebase more robust and maintainable.
   - **Approach**: I used TypeScript to define the props and state types for components, ensuring that data flows correctly and reducing runtime errors.

3. **SCSS for Enhanced Styling**:

   - **Reason**: SCSS (Sass) extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins, which help in writing cleaner and more maintainable stylesheets.
   - **Approach**: I used SCSS variables for consistent theming, nested rules for better readability, and mixins for reusable styles across different components.

4. **State Management**:

   - **Reason**: Proper state management ensures that your application is scalable and the state is predictable. You might use React's built-in state management or a state management library like Redux.
   - **Approach**: I managed the global state for user authentication and UI state in a centralized store, ensuring that the components react to state changes consistently.

5. **Responsive Design**:

   - **Reason**: Ensuring that the application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes is crucial for a good user experience.
   - **Approach**: I used CSS media queries and flexible layouts to ensure that the design adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

6. **Code Organization and Structure**:

   - **Reason**: A well-organized codebase improves maintainability and collaboration. Following best practices for folder structure and naming conventions makes the project easier to navigate.
   - **Approach**: I structured your project with separate folders for components, styles, and utilities, and followed consistent naming conventions.

7. **Version Control**:

   - **Reason**: Using version control (e.g., Git) allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous states if needed.
   - **Approach**: I maintained a Git repository for the project, making regular commits to document my progress and changes.

8. **User Experience (UX) Considerations**:
   - **Reason**: A good UX ensures that the application is intuitive and easy to use. Paying attention to details like navigation, feedback, and performance is crucial.
   - **Approach**: I ensured smooth navigation and quick load times, and provided user feedback for actions like form submissions and errors.
